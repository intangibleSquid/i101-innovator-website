                Radia Perlman is an underrepresented innovator in the world of IT, Computer Science and Networking.
                <br><br style="line-height: 0.4em;">  <!-- line breaks (one with custom spacing) -->
                Radia was born on December 18, 1951 in Portsmouth, Virginia. Perlman earned her PhD at the Massachusetts
                Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1988. Perlman is also known for being gifted in music and poetry. She is often
                referred to as the "Mother of the Internet," a title which she humbly denies, citing that the internet only is what
                it is today due to the contributions of numerous bright minds in her field. She wrote a wonderfully illustrative
                poem, or as she would call it, her algorithm's "Algorhyme" about her most well-known contribution,
                Spanning-Tree Protocol, or STP, and we really wanted to highlight it here.

            <p>  <!-- content paragraph -->
                Before delving into the obligatory list of Radia Perlman's contributions to technology, informatics, and computing, we wanted to highlight 
                something about her that we've already briefly touched on, something that her colleagues deem an integral element of her contributions to any 
                field. To quote the article Radia Perlman on She Thought It, "Radia Perlman is not only known for her major contributions to the Internet, but 
                also for being a poet and for loving music," they go on to quote Perlman as insisting, "Every algorithm ought to have an associated algorhyme" 
                (Stamatopoulou, 2019). In a field of technologically fascinating, yet dour and rigid whitepapers and other scholarly literature, we posit that 
                Radia Perlman brought a warm, human element to a somewhat cold, mechanical field. Her radiant enthusiasm for technology, networking, and 
                telecommunications alone is worth highlighting. Again, to quote She Thought It, "she didn't hesitate to play on the piano the piece Rondo 
                Capriccioso, composed by the French composer Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns, for a National Inventors Hall of Fame video, or to perform stand-up comedy in 
                a passenger talent show, while she was on a cruise to Russia to see a solar eclipse" (Stamatopoulou, 2019). The many facets to her personality 
                are truly inspiring and, innovations aside, if more people were like Radia Perlman, the world would be a much more jovial place. 
                <br><br>  <!-- line breaks -->
                Radia Perlman approached technology with a zeal commensurate with her enthusiasm for life. To say that she found equal success would be an 
                understatement. She worked hand in hand with International Business Machines (IBM) to develop several routing standards, predominantly the Open 
                Systems Interconnections Interdomain Routing Protocol (IDRP) (Stamatopoulou, 2019). In addition to IBM, she also worked with Cisco Systems Inc. 
                to standardize the IDRP protocol by serving on the prestigious American National Standards Institute (ANSI) sub-committee (Stamatopoulou, 2019). 
                Aside from her contributions to IDRP, Perlman also played such a significant role in early innovation of Interconnected Networks and the Internet 
                that she was dubbed the, "Mother of the Internet" (LMIT, 2023). This moniker was earned primarily due to her invention of the algorithm behind 
                the aforementioned Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which was a critical piece of the puzzle of high-density, broad-spectrum information routing 
                (LMIT, 2023). To quote LMIT, Perlman is described as, "having put the 'basic traffic rules' into place for the Internet" (LMIT, 2023). This 
                protocol remains in use to this day, having seen widespread adoption by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as a 
                standard for bridge technology (LMIT, 2023). While Perlman contributed so much to the fields of information technology, telecommunications, and 
                computer science as a whole, her last innovation that we wanted to highlight was to the field of network security. While working for Sun 
                Microsystems, she reconstituted her previous breakthroughs with STP but on a cybersecurity front when she redesigned her algorithm to be "more 
                robust, more stable, and... to establish optimal paths between points" while working on a project dubbed Transparent Interconnection of Lots of 
                Links, or TRILL (LMIT, 2023). In addition to TRILL, she also pushed cryptography forward with her "ephemerizer" project, which enabled users to 
                ensure that encrypted data couldn't be accessed after a preset expiration date, via subsequent destruction of encryption keys (LMIT, 2023). Radia 
                Perlman made so many innovations to her many fields, and aside from her clever naming conventions, ingenuity, and creativity, she was always the 
                light in an otherwise dark room, and her poetry makes understanding some of the most complex issues in telecommunications trivial and a joy.
